# Eye Cursor
an eye tracking addon to help with your workflow / browsing

Progress: ~20%

What's missing:
* Eye tracking
* Calibration / Scaling with the screen
* X11 mouse integration

# Installation

Requires OpenCV, currently being developed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Sorry / Not Sorry if you're using another OS, my focus is on getting a working webcam-only eye-tracker.

I recommend the following for installing OpenCV:

# Alternatives

This awesome thing: [WebGazer](https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer)

Here are some other links for non-open source / non-webcam projects:

* [xLabs](https://xlabsgaze.com/) (not open source, takes a bit of training)
* [GazeRecorder](https://www.facebook.com/gazerecorder) (sort of open source. windows-only, and where's the code?)
* [PyGaze](https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyGaze) (open source. this might work, haven't installed it)
* [Pupil](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil) (open software/hardware, but maybe not everyone knows how to solder their webcam)
* [theeyetribe](http://theeyetribe.com/) ($200)
* [GazeHawk](http://gazehawk.com/) (quote "Our proprietary eye tracking technology...")
* [Sticky](https://sticky.ad/) (proprietary / I think they do the analysis server-side?)
